## What is SystemC

SystemC is a collection of classes and libraries that provide event driven simulation for a system modeling language called SystemC. Its a way to enable hardware modeling functionality within C++. SystemC is based on C++, which gives it speed and flexibility.

Being based on C++, SystemC doesnt require any special EDA tool in order to use it. All you need is a C++ compiler that you can link your installation to.

Knowledge of C++ and basic hardware concepts(like clocks, gates and waveforms) is required in order to understand this.

## Repository structure

This repository contains few sub-directoires

     ├── examples                 # directory with examples

         └── synthesizable        # directory containing examples synthesizable by HLS tools


## Installation

Dependencies:

- For Debian/Ubuntu and Ubuntu based distros
```
sudo apt install build-essential make wget git
```

- For Arch, Manjaro and other Arch based distros
```
sudo pacman -S gcc make wget git
```

SystemC can be downloaded, free of charge, from Accellera's website.

Steps:
1. Open terminal and type
```
wget http://www.accellera.org/images/downloads/standards/systemc/systemc-2.3.3.gz
```
This downloads the SystemC tarball

2. Unpacking the package and making directories
```
tar -xzf systemc-2.3.3.gz
sudo mkdir /usr/local/systemc-2.3.3/
cd systemc-2.3.3 && mkdir objdir && cd objdir
```

3. Final installation
```
sudo ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.3/
sudo make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

## Compile the program

### For Linux

First clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/AleksandarKostovic/SystemC-tutorial.git
```

Then run the command to compile SystemC into executable called hello

```
g++ -I. -I /usr/local/systemc-2.3.3/include -L. -L/usr/local/systemc-2.3.3/lib-linux64 -Wl,-rpath=/usr/local/systemc-2.3.3/lib-linux64 -lsystemc -lm -o hello hello.cpp
```

In the examples i provided makefiles so all you have to do is type make in the example directory


Now, type `./hello` to run the exectutable and you should get this:

```

Hello World!

```

## Keywords introduced and some building concepts

## sc_main
`sc_main` is the master function. When building a system based on SystemC, `sc_main` is going the whole system's main function. You can build multiple functions, but `sc_main` must be present. Like in hello world example:

```c++
#include <systemc.h>

SC_MODULE (hello) {  // module named hello
  SC_CTOR (hello) {  //constructor phase, which is empty in this case
  }

  void say_hello() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
  }
};

int sc_main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  hello h("hello");
  h.say_hello();
  return 0;
}
```

We have two functions. The `say_hello` is responsable for outputing text, while the `sc_main` is passing the `say_hello` function and returning 0(success).

## SC_MODULE

`SC_MODULE` is meant to be a declaration of a complete module/part. It has the same intention as `module` in Verilog, but just in SystemC style.

## SC_CTOR

`SC_CTOR` is macro file for a SystemC contructor. It does several things:
 - Declares sensitivty list.
 
 In SystemC a sensitivity list is part of constructor which declares which signals are most sensitive. For example:
 
 ```c++
 sensitive << clk.pos(); 
 ```
 This tells the module that the design is sensitive to clock, the positive edge in this case.
 
 - Register each function as a process happening in a module.
 
 - Create design hierarchy if you are including serval modules to give whole design sense of module usage.
 
 ## Threads
 
 Thread is a function made to act like a hardware process. It has a few features:
 - Runs concurrently - Multiple processes can be started at the same time(note that every function in systemc is a process)
 - They are sensitive to signals.
 - They are not called by user, but rather always active.
 - There are three types of threads: `SC_METHOD`, `SC_THREAD`, `SC_CTHREAD`.
 
### `SC_METHOD`
- Limited to single clock cycle. Fine for simple sequential logic
- They execute once every sensiteve event
- They run continuosly
- Are synthesizable
- Are comparable to Verilog's `always @` block

### `SC_THREAD`
- Runs once at the start of the simulation, than suspends ifself when done.
- Can conatin infinite loop
- Comparable to Verilog's `@ initial` block
- Not syntesyzable
- Typicly used in testbecnhes to describe clocks

### `SC_CTHREAD` - clocked threads
- Syntesyzable
- Not limited to one cycle
- Can contain continuous loops
- Can contain large blocks of code for control or code with operations
- Used for behavioral syntesis
- Run continuously
- Can take more clock cycles to execute a single iteration
- Used for 99% of SystemC designs
- Similar to Verilog's `always @ (pos/negedge clock)`
