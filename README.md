# SystemC tutorial

## Whats is SystemC

SystemC is a set of classes and libraries that provide event driven simulation. SystemC is based on C++, which gives it speed and flexibility.

Being based on C++, SystemC doesnt require any special EDA tool in order to use it. All you need is a C++ compiler that you can link your installation to.

Knowledge of C++ is required in order to understand this.
